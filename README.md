# dictionary-website
A simple front-end website that makes API calls to a dictionary and returns selected information

## Overview
This repository has the files for a basic (but useful) website through which you can look up the meaning and origin of a word. The site makes API calls to the Merriam-Webster dictionary and process the JSON response before updating the content on the page.

## Files Included
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- images (folder with the necessary images)

Once all the above are in the same directory, the website can be launched by opening **index.html** in any web browser.

### Some Included Features
- provides the definition and (where available) the word origin (and date)
- displays pronunciation(s)
- if a word is misspelled-but-close-enough, clickable suggestions will be offered
- if a word has a meaning flagged as offensive, a warning will be displayed first (try inputting curse words!)
- fun easter eggs when you hover on different parts of the page
